This allows the application to use the development-specific configuration properties defined in application-dev.properties, which are optimized for development and testing environments. In production, this can be overridden by setting the environment variable SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod to use the production-specific configuration defined in application-prod.properties.
